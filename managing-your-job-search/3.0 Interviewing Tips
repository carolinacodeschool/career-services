Interviewing can be a scary part of the job search process, but it doesn't need to be! We have a few resources that can help you prepare for interviews and technical interviews.

TechStack'd has put together this nice overview of the interview process, including
  Types of Technical Interviews
  Debunked many myths about interviewing, including that there is NOT just one particular answer that interviewers are looking for. There are many ways to solve the coding problems
  Halli's formula for getting through an interview confidently (and why having your own formula will help you succeed in your interviews)
  What makes interviewers say "yes" or "no" to candidates
  What to do when you get stuck in during a technical interview
